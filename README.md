# Liquidity Provider Server

This is a server that interacts with a [Liquidity Bridge Contract (LBC)](https://github.com/rsksmart/liquidity-bridge-contract) to provide liquidity for users 
as part of the Flyover protocol. The server runs a local [Liquidity Provider (LP)](https://github.com/rsksmart/liquidity-provider), and also allows connections
from remote LPs.

The server's functionality is provided through a JSON HTTP interface. In addition, the server needs access to a Bitcoin and an RSK node.
