# Financial Reports

## Overview

The Liquidity Provider Server provides financial reporting endpoints to monitor operations, track profitability, and analyze capital allocation. All reports are available through the Management UI (Reports section) or via API.

**Common Conventions:**
- All amounts are in wei (1 BTC/RBTC = 10^18 wei, 1 satoshi = 10^10 wei)
- Date parameters accept YYYY-MM-DD format (expands to full day) or ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ)
- All endpoints require Management API authentication
- Amounts are returned as strings to preserve precision

## Dashboard Summary

**Parameters:**
- `startDate` (required): Start date for the report period
- `endDate` (required): End date for the report period

**Purpose:** Aggregate statistics for both pegin and pegout operations during a time period.
